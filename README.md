# A Lean Companion to _Conceptual Mathematics_

This _Companion_ aims to formalise most of the definitions, theorems, and exercises in the second edition of Lawvere and Schanuel's _Conceptual Mathematics_ using Lean 4 and mathlib.

The _Companion_ has been written in Verso and is hosted at https://davidkinkead.github.io/conceptual_mathematics

Files containing just the unannotated Lean code for each Article and Session have been automatically generated by Verso and reside in the folder [_out/cm-code/ConceptualMathematics](https://github.com/davidkinkead/conceptual_mathematics/tree/master/_out/cm-code/ConceptualMathematics)

This _Companion_ is the result of a project I undertook to learn both Lean and some elementary category theory at the same time (and ultimately a decent amount about Verso too). It remains a work in progress[^1]. It will contain plenty of opportunities for improvement and more than a few errors! I welcome any comments, suggestions, corrections, or contributions. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

[^1]: At the present time, it is mostly complete through Session 15, so currently covers just over half of the book.
