In fact, all its periods are multiples of this smallest one\" (p. 177). Since 5 and 7 are coprime, their only positive common divisor is 1, and so the only element having both period 5 and period 7 is an element having period 1—that is, a fixed point. We proceed via Bézout's identity, {7 \\times 3 − 5 \\times 4 = 1}.open Function\nexample {X : Type} (α : End X) (x : X)\n    : (α ^ 5) x = x ∧ (α ^ 7) x = x → α x = x := by\n  rintro ⟨h5, h7⟩\n  change α^[5] x = x at h5\n  change α^[7] x = x at h7\n  nth_rw 1 [← h5, ← h5, ← h5, ← h5, ← iterate_one α]\n  nth_rw 2 [← h7, ← h7, ← h7]\n  repeat rw [← iterate_add_apply α 5 _ x]\n  rw [← iterate_add_apply α 1 20 x]\n  repeat rw [← iterate_add_apply α 7 _ x]\n\n\n","context":"A Lean Companion to Conceptual Mathematics\u0009Session 15: Objectification of properties in dynamical systems","header":"2.
