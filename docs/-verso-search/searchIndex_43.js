Suppose that we have two continuous maps {D \\xrightarrow{f} D} [and] {D \\xrightarrow{g} D}, and that g satisfies {g \\circ j = j}. Use the retraction theorem to show that there must be a point x in the disk at which {f(x) = g(x)}. (Hint: The fixed point theorem is the special case {g = 1_D}, so try to generalize the argument we used in that special case.)\n\nTODO Exercise 10.1\n\nSuppose that A is a 'retract' of X, i.e. there are maps {A \\xrightarrow{s} X \\xrightarrow{r} A} with {r \\circ s = 1_A}. Suppose also that X has the fixed point property for maps from T, i.e. for every endomap {X \\xrightarrow{f} X}, there is a map {T \\xrightarrow{x} X} for which {f x = x}. Show that A also has the fixed point property for maps from T. (Hint: The proof should work in any category, so it should only use the algebra of composition of maps.)\n\nTODO Exercise 10.2\n\nUse the result of the preceding exercise, and the fact that the antipodal map has no fixed point, to deduce each retraction theorem from the corresponding fixed point theorem.\n\nTODO Exercise 10.3\n\n","context":"A Lean Companion to Conceptual Mathematics\u0009Session 10: Brouwer's theorems","header":"4.
