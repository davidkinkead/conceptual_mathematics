(You will need to introduce the object \\mathbf{1}.)(c) Guess a stronger version of Brouwer’s fixed point theorem in two dimensions, by replacing E, I, and R by the circle, disk, and plane. (You can do it in three dimensions too, if you want.)(d) Try to test your guess in (c); e.g. try to invent maps for which your conjectured theorem is not true.\n\nTODO Exercise 10.4\n\n\n\n","context":"A Lean Companion to Conceptual Mathematics\u0009Session 10: Brouwer's theorems","header":"7.
