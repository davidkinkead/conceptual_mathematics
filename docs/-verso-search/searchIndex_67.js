A proof that the two definitions of isomorphism are equivalent is given below.\n\n\n\nexample {𝒞 : Type u} [Category.{v, u} 𝒞] {A B : 𝒞}\n    (f : A ⟶ B) (r : Retraction f) (s : Section f)\n    : r.retraction = s.section_ ↔ IsIso f := by\n  constructor\n  · intro h\n    exact {\n      out := by\n        use r.retraction\n        constructor\n        · exact r.id\n        · rw [h]\n          exact s.id\n    }\n  · rintro ⟨finv, hfinv⟩\n    obtain ⟨r, hr⟩ := r\n    obtain ⟨s, hs⟩ := s\n    change r = s\n    calc\n      r = r ⊚ 𝟙 B := by rw [Category.id_comp]\n      _ = r ⊚ (f ⊚ s) := by rw [hs]\n      _ = (r ⊚ f) ⊚ s := by rw [← Category.assoc]\n      _ = 𝟙 A ⊚ s := by rw [← hr]\n      _ = s := Category.comp_id s\n\n\nWhen working with inverse maps in Excercise 10, we make use of mathlib's CategoryTheory.inv, which we print below for reference.\n\n#print CategoryTheory.inv\n\n\ndef CategoryTheory.inv.{v, u} : {C : Type u} →\n  [inst : Category.{v, u} C] → {X Y : C} → (f : X ⟶ Y) → [I : IsIso f] → Y ⟶ X :=\nfun {C} [Category.{v, u} C] {X Y} f [IsIso f] ↦ Classical.choose ⋯\n\n\nIf {A \\xrightarrow{f} B \\xrightarrow{g} C} are both isomorphisms, then {g \\circ f} is an isomorphism too, and {(g \\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1}}.\n\nThe inverse of the composite is the composite of the inverses in the opposite order.open CategoryTheory in\nexample {𝒞 : Type u} [Category.{v, u} 𝒞] {A B C : 𝒞}\n    (f : A ⟶ B) [hf : IsIso f] (g : B ⟶ C) [hg : IsIso g]\n    : IsIso (g ⊚ f) ∧ inv (g ⊚ f) = inv f ⊚ inv g := by\n  constructor\n  · obtain ⟨finv, hfinv⟩ := hf\n    obtain ⟨ginv, hginv⟩ := hg\n    exact {\n      out := by\n        use finv ⊚ ginv\n        constructor\n        · rw [Category.assoc, ← Category.assoc g]\n          rw [hginv.1]\n          rw [Category.id_comp]\n          exact hfinv.1\n        · rw [Category.assoc, ← Category.assoc finv]\n          rw [hfinv.2]\n          rw [Category.id_comp]\n          exact hginv.2\n    }\n  · exact IsIso.inv_comp\n\n\nIf {A = \\{\\mathit{Fatima}, \\mathit{Omer}, \\mathit{Alysia}\\}} and {B = \\{\\mathit{coffee}, \\mathit{tea}, \\mathit{cocoa}\\}}, find an example of an isomorphism {A \\xrightarrow{f} B}.

How many automorphisms of A are there? The answers should be less than 27 — why?\n\nProvided two sets/types have the same number n of elements, the number of isomorphisms between them is n!; if the sets/types have different numbers of elements, then there are no isomorphisms between them. We implement this formula in Lean as follows:def isoCount (α β : Type*) [Fintype α] [Fintype β] : ℕ :=\n  if Fintype.card α = Fintype.card β then\n    Nat.factorial (Fintype.card α)\n  else\n    0\nBy the formula above, we have 6 different isomorphisms.open ExII_11\n\n#eval isoCount A B\n6\nEssentially the same formula applies to automorphisms, since an automorphism is just an isomorphism from a set/type to itself. Thus, there are also 6 different automorphisms of A.abbrev autCount (α : Type*) [Fintype α] := isoCount α α\nopen ExII_11\n\n#eval autCount A\n6\nBy Alysia's formula, {3^3 = 27} is the number of distinct maps {A \\rightarrow B} (or {A \\rightarrow A}), so the number of isomorphisms between A and B (or automorphisms of A) must be less than 27.\n\nAn automorphism in the category of sets is also traditionally called a permutation, suggesting that it shifts the elements of its set around in a specified way.\n\nRepeating the second part of Exercise 12, now using sets instead of types, we have\n\n\n\ndef permCount {α : Type*} (s : Finset α) : ℕ :=\n  if 0 < Finset.card s then\n    Nat.factorial (Finset.card s)\n  else\n    0\n\n\nopen ExII_11\n\n#eval permCount (Finset.univ (α := A))\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n","context":"A Lean Companion to Conceptual Mathematics\u0009Article II: Isomorphisms","header":"4.
