On the other hand, in Exercise 17 of Article III, another description was given in terms of two sets and four structural maps. Explain in what sense these two descriptions give the 'same' category.\n\nTODO Exercise 16.1\n\n\n\n","context":"A Lean Companion to Conceptual Mathematics\u0009Session 16: Idempotents, involutions, and graphs","header":"2.
